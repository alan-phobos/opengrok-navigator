# OpenGrok Navigator

A VS Code extension that allows you to quickly open the current line of code in your OpenGrok instance.

## Features

- **Open in OpenGrok**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+O` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+O` (Mac) to open the current line in OpenGrok
- **Copy OpenGrok URL**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+C` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+C` (Mac) to copy the OpenGrok URL to clipboard
- **Search in OpenGrok**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+F` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+F` (Mac) to search selected text or enter a search term
- **Context Menu**: Right-click in the editor and select "Open in OpenGrok", "Copy OpenGrok URL", or "Search in OpenGrok"
- **Configurable**: Set your OpenGrok base URL in VS Code settings
- **Integrated Browser**: Optionally open links in VS Code's built-in Simple Browser

## Installation

### From Source

1. Clone or download this extension
2. Open the extension folder in VS Code
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
4. Run `npm run compile` to compile the TypeScript code
5. Press `F5` to launch a new VS Code window with the extension loaded

### Packaging and Installing

1. Install vsce: `npm install -g @vscode/vsce`
2. Package the extension: `vsce package`
3. Install the `.vsix` file: In VS Code, go to Extensions → "..." menu → "Install from VSIX"

## Configuration

Before using the extension, configure your OpenGrok base URL:

1. Open VS Code Settings (`Ctrl+,` or `Cmd+,`)
2. Search for "OpenGrok Navigator"
3. Set the following settings:
   - **Base URL**: Your OpenGrok instance URL (e.g., `http://opengrok.example.com/source`)
   - **Project Root** (optional): If your project in OpenGrok has a different root path
   - **Use Integrated Browser** (optional): Enable to open OpenGrok links in VS Code's built-in Simple Browser instead of your system browser (default: disabled)
   - **Use Top Level Folder** (optional): Use the top-level folder name within the workspace as the OpenGrok project name instead of the workspace name. Useful for workspaces containing multiple projects (default: disabled)

Example settings in `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "opengrok-navigator.baseUrl": "http://localhost:8080/source",
  "opengrok-navigator.projectRoot": "",
  "opengrok-navigator.useIntegratedBrowser": false,
  "opengrok-navigator.useTopLevelFolder": false
}
```

### Multi-Project Workspaces

If your workspace contains multiple projects (each in its own top-level folder) and each maps to a different OpenGrok project, enable the **Use Top Level Folder** option:

**Example structure:**
```
/workspace-root/
├── project-a/
│   └── src/
│       └── main.ts
└── project-b/
    └── src/
        └── main.ts
```

With `useTopLevelFolder: true`, files in `project-a/src/main.ts` will generate URLs like:
```
http://localhost:8080/source/xref/project-a/src/main.ts#10
```

Instead of the default (workspace name):
```
http://localhost:8080/source/xref/workspace-root/project-a/src/main.ts#10
```

## Usage

### Opening in OpenGrok

1. Open a file in VS Code
2. Place your cursor on the line you want to view in OpenGrok
3. Use one of the following methods:
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+O` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+O` (Mac)
   - Right-click and select "Open in OpenGrok" from the context menu
4. Your browser will open to the corresponding line in OpenGrok

### Copying OpenGrok URL

1. Open a file in VS Code
2. Place your cursor on the line you want to reference
3. Use one of the following methods:
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+C` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+C` (Mac)
   - Right-click and select "Copy OpenGrok URL" from the context menu
4. The URL will be copied to your clipboard

### Searching in OpenGrok

1. Optionally, select text in the editor that you want to search for
2. Use one of the following methods:
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+F` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+F` (Mac)
   - Right-click and select "Search in OpenGrok" from the context menu
3. If you had text selected, it will search for that text. Otherwise, you'll be prompted to enter a search term
4. The search query will be quoted for an exact match (e.g., `"searchTerm"`)
5. OpenGrok search results will open in your browser

## How It Works

The extension:
1. Gets the current file path relative to your workspace
2. Gets the current line number (1-indexed)
3. Constructs an OpenGrok URL in the format: `{baseUrl}/xref/{relativePath}#{lineNumber}`
4. Opens the URL in your default browser

## Requirements

- VS Code 1.74.0 or higher
- A running OpenGrok instance
- Files must be part of a workspace (not standalone files)

## Known Issues

- Only works with files that are part of a workspace
- Assumes standard OpenGrok URL structure (`/xref/` for cross-reference view)
