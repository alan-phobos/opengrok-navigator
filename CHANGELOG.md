# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Build System**: Comprehensive Makefile for building both extensions with single command
  - `make` or `make dist` - Build everything and create a single distribution zip
  - `make build-vscode` - Build VS Code extension only
  - `make build-chrome` - Package Chrome extension only
  - `make clean` - Remove all build artifacts
  - `make source` - Create source-only distribution
  - `make dev` - Quick development build (no clean)
  - Automatic versioning from package.json
  - Creates single `opengrok-navigator-vX.Y.Z.zip` containing both extensions and documentation
  - Includes VERSION.txt file listing package contents

- **Quick File Finder** (Chrome Extension): Now a core feature (no longer experimental)
  - Server-side search using OpenGrok REST API `/api/v1/search?path=*query*`
  - Real-time search as you type (300ms debounce)
  - Dual-action results: Enter to open in OpenGrok, Shift+Enter to open in VS Code
  - Displays filename + directory path for each result
  - Works with any repository size (no pre-loading required)
  - Press `T` on any OpenGrok page to activate
  - Clear error messages for API unavailability or authentication issues

- **SSL Certificate Support**:
  - VS Code Extension: `opengrok-navigator.rejectUnauthorized` setting to disable certificate verification for self-signed certificates
  - Configuration option with clear warning about security implications

- **License and Build Files**:
  - LICENSE file (MIT)
  - .vscodeignore file for cleaner VS Code extension packaging
  - BUILD.md with comprehensive build instructions
  - Updated .gitignore for dist/ directory and build artifacts

### Changed
- **Chrome Extension Settings**: Reorganized settings page
  - Removed "Experimental Features" section
  - Added "Quick File Finder" section with usage instructions
  - Simplified settings UI

### Fixed
- **Chrome Extension**: Fixed duplicate project name in Quick File Finder URLs
  - API returns paths with project prefix, now properly stripped to avoid duplication
  - Example: Fixed `/xref/illumos-gate//illumos-gate/path` → `/xref/illumos-gate/path`

- **VS Code Extension**: Fixed warnings during build
  - Added LICENSE file to vscode-extension/ directory to suppress missing license warning
  - Added .vscodeignore file to suppress packaging warning
  - Cleaner build output with no warnings

### Removed
- **Chrome Extension**: Removed experimental feature flag for Quick File Finder
  - Feature is now always enabled
  - Removed experimentalFileFinder from storage
  - Removed conditional loading code

## Design Decisions

### Quick File Finder Redesign
See [docs/QUICK_FILE_FINDER_DESIGN.md](docs/QUICK_FILE_FINDER_DESIGN.md) for full design rationale.

**Key decisions:**
1. **Server-side search** instead of client-side filtering - Works with repos of any size
2. **Wildcard wrapping** (`*query*`) for intuitive substring matching
3. **No fallback to page scraping** - Clear error messages instead of unreliable behavior

### Build System Design
- Single command (`make`) to build everything
- Automatic version extraction from package.json
- Separate targets for development (`make dev`) and distribution (`make dist`)
- Clean separation of source, build artifacts, and distribution packages

## Migration Notes

### For Users
- The Quick File Finder is now always available (no need to enable experimental features)
- If you were using the experimental file finder, your experience is now improved with server-side search

### For Developers
- Run `make` to build both extensions
- Distribution packages are created in `dist/` directory
- See BUILD.md for detailed build instructions
