  - Includes VERSION.txt file listing package contents

- **Quick File Finder** (Chrome Extension): Now a core feature (no longer experimental)
  - Server-side search using OpenGrok REST API `/api/v1/search?path=*query*`
  - Real-time search as you type (300ms debounce)

  - Displays filename + directory path for each result

### Removed

  - Removed experimentalFileFinder from storage
  - Removed conditional loading code

## Design Decisions

### Quick File Finder Redesign
See [docs/QUICK_FILE_FINDER_DESIGN.md](docs/QUICK_FILE_FINDER_DESIGN.md) for full design rationale.

**Key decisions:**
1. **Server-side search** instead of client-side filtering - Works with repos of any size
2. **Wildcard wrapping** (`*query*`) for intuitive substring matching
3. **No fallback to page scraping** - Clear error messages instead of unreliable behavior

### Build System Design
- Single command (`make`) to build everything
- Automatic version extraction from package.json
- Separate targets for development (`make dev`) and distribution (`make dist`)
- Clean separation of source, build artifacts, and distribution packages

## Migration Notes

### For Users
- The Quick File Finder is now always available (no need to enable experimental features)
- If you were using the experimental file finder, your experience is now improved with server-side search

### For Developers
- Run `make` to build both extensions
- Distribution packages are created in `dist/` directory
- See BUILD.md for detailed build instructions
